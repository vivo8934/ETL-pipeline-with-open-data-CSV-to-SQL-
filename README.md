# ETL-pipeline-with-open-data-CSV-to-SQL-
ETL concepts—data extraction, transformation, and loading—while giving exposure to cloud tools like AWS Redshift


This project entails building an ETL pipeline using a publicly available dataset, such as weather . You will extract the data from a CSV file, clean and transform it using Python (with a library like Pandas), and load the transformed data into AWS Redshift, a cloud-based data warehouse.

## Skills developed

- Extracting data from CSV with Python
- Transforming and cleaning data with Python
- Loading data into BigQuery with Python and SQL
